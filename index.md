Welcome to **Built-Environment-Edinburgh**.  
We are a student-led group at the University of Edinburgh, dedicated to research and knowledge exchange in sustainable and resilient built environments. We welcome participation from both internal and external collaborators, including professionals, researchers, and practitioners interested in building science.

We aim to host monthly events, ranging from project talks and research sharing to skill-development sessions (including academic writing and related workshops).

Use this site to explore our people, projects, and publications.
