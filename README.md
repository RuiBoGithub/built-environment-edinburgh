Welcome to `Built-Environment-Edinburgh`.

- We are a student-led group at the University of Edinburgh focused on research and knowledge exchange in **sustainable and resilient built environments**.
- We welcome participation from:
  - Internal students
  - External collaborators
- Our activities include **monthly events**, such as:
  - Project presentations
  - Research-sharing sessions
  - Skill-development workshops (e.g., academic writing and related training)
 
This is a space to update, share, and engage with ongoing work in the `Built-Environment-Edinburgh` community.
