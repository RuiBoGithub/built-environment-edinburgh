Welcome to `Built-Environment-Edinburgh`.

It is a student-led group at the University of Edinburgh focused on research and knowledge exchange in **sustainable and resilient built environments**, where both internal and external participation is welcomed. Main activities include **monthly events**, such as:
  - Project presentations
  - Research-sharing sessions
  - Skill-development workshops (e.g., academic writing and related training)
 
This is a space to update, share, and engage with ongoing work in the `Built-Environment-Edinburgh` community.
